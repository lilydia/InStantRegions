				Hi! My name is Lydia, a first year Electrical Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. 
				I am thrilled by the technical world and am motivated to combine the art of design with the art of programming! 
				During the creation of this chat room, I bridged the gap between graphical design and technical implementation, 
				taking an active role on both sides and defining how the application looks as well as how it works.
